      summary: Information about a particular (potentially non-persistant) instance of a layer
      description: This endpoint provides information about an instance of a specific *Cloudburst* layer that can be requested as map tiles. Instances are typically added and removed as the data underlying a dataset changes with time (e.g. forecasts expire, and forecast horizons continuously move forward). Therefore a particular instance of a layer may not be persistant.

      description: This endpoint exposes the array of moments that data exists for a particular instance. Each element can be used to substitute the <time> part of a tile URL. Not all layer instances have a temporal dimension (e.g. it may be static bathymetry, or an observational dataset with no forecast or hindcast). If a layer has no temporal dimension, the array will be empty. The times in the array may not be unique (this is almost always due to grouped datasets containing overlapping time steps).

      summary: A tiled map image, for use by map clients capable of consuming PNG map images in OGC TMS coordinate notation.
      description: Cloudburst produces map tiles, and PNG map tiles are the traditional format for representing these. Other possibilities include protocol-buffer vector tiles in the Mapbox vector tile specification, and others. This endpoint will most often be used by map clients (such as Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS, OpenLayers, and Google Maps), which know exactly which tiles to request for a given geographical map view and zoom level. **The Cloudburst Javascript API is responsible for completing the resource URI via these client libraries, based on what a user is authenticated to request, and what these layers support, via requests to other endpoints. Manual requests are possible but are not recommended.** The resources for a particular layer can be discovered through a `GET` request to `/layer/<layerId>/` and inspecting the response's `resources` property. The `/layer/<layerId>/<instanceID>/times/` endpoints can be used to request the times that are valid (many layer instances have only one time and/or vertical level).

  Metadata:
    type: object
    description: Metadata for a layer. Cloudburst supports an arbitrary metadata document, but these specified keys are useful and will tend to exist, but none of them is mandatory, and a property may exist but have a null value.
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: A short, human-readable description of a layer that is suitable for inclusion in a list of available layers.
      description:
        type: string
        description: A long description of a layer, possibly including HTML tags to navigate users to glossaries or other sources of additional information.
      organisation:
        type: string
        description: Organisation responsible for publishing the data used in the layer.
      source:
        type: string

      regions:

          type: string
          description: A three-digit numerical code used by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Secretariat. Represents geographical regions where the layer is considered applicable, from the global scale ('001'), to continental, sub-continental, and country scales. See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm for the list of values in current use.
      unit_system:
        type: string
        description: The system of units that the layer renders quantitative values in. Examples include "metric" and "uscs", for layers that render with metric and United States customary system (USCS) units, respectively. A null value indicates that the unit system is unspecified or does not fit into a category (e.g. knots). This does not indicate exactly which units a plot will render, only a broad classification. This can be used to filter duplicate layers that only differ in whether they render the same physical phenomenon as, for example, millimetres or inches. There is no restriction on what value this string may take.
